first create a repo on github
copy the address
clone it to your local machine (any folder that you like):
git clone <address>

go to that cloned folder (which is your repository)

once you have added some files then do the following:

git add .
git commit -m "<comment>"
git push origin <branch-name>

check online if you like to verify the changes
